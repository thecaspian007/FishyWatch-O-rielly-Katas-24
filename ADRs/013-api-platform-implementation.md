# ADR-002: API Platform Implementation for Fishy Watch

## Date:
2024-04-04

## Status:
Accepted

## Context:
The Fishy Watch system requires a robust API platform to expose and manage APIs for communication between different system components, external services, and third-party integrations. The API platform should include components like an API gateway, ambassador, request and response handlers, and other necessary functionalities to ensure secure, reliable, and efficient API interactions.

## Decision:
1. **API Gateway**:
   - Implement an API gateway as a central entry point for API requests, handling authentication, authorization, rate limiting, logging, and monitoring.
   - Utilize API gateway features for routing requests, transforming payloads, versioning APIs, and enforcing security policies (e.g., OAuth2, JWT).

2. **Ambassador Pattern**:
   - Adopt the ambassador pattern to abstract service-specific communication logic from API clients, providing a lightweight proxy layer for service interactions.
   - Use ambassadors for service discovery, load balancing, circuit breaking, and fault tolerance in API communication.

3. **Request and Response Handlers**:
   - Implement request handlers to validate, sanitize, and process incoming API requests, ensuring data integrity, format compliance, and security checks.
   - Develop response handlers to format and transform API responses, handle errors, enforce API contracts, and provide consistent responses to clients.

4. **API Documentation and Developer Portal**:
   - Create comprehensive API documentation using tools like Swagger/OpenAPI to describe API endpoints, parameters, payloads, and usage instructions.
   - Set up a developer portal for API consumers to explore APIs, obtain API keys, access documentation, and test API requests interactively.

## Consequences:
### PROS:
- **Centralized API Management**: API gateway centralizes API management tasks, simplifies API interactions, and enforces security and governance policies.
- **Scalability and Flexibility**: Ambassador pattern enables flexible service communication, dynamic routing, and seamless integration of new services without client changes.
- **Security and Compliance**: API gateway enforces security measures, access controls, and compliance standards (e.g., GDPR, PCI-DSS) for API interactions.
- **Developer Experience**: API documentation and developer portal enhance developer experience, facilitate API adoption, and promote collaboration with external developers.

### Cons:
- **Complexity**: Implementing and managing an API platform with multiple components (gateway, ambassador, handlers) may introduce complexity in configuration, monitoring, and troubleshooting.
- **Performance Overhead**: API gateway and handlers may introduce latency and processing overhead, impacting API response times, especially for high-throughput APIs.

## Notes:
- Configure API gateway rules, policies, and routing configurations based on API design best practices, security requirements, and business logic.
- Monitor API traffic, performance metrics, error rates, and usage patterns using monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, ELK Stack) integrated with the API platform.
- Implement logging, auditing, and anomaly detection mechanisms in the API platform to detect and respond to security threats, abnormal API behavior, and operational issues.
- Regularly update API documentation, version APIs appropriately, and communicate changes to API consumers through release notes, notifications, or changelogs.
