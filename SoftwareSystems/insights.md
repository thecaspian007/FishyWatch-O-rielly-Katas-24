## Insights Details

| Insight Name                       | Insight Description                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | 
| ***Fish Health Insights***         | <br> - Identify trends in fish health metrics such as activity levels, growth rates, and disease prevalence. <br> - Provide recommendations for improving fish health based on correlations with environmental factors, water quality, and feeding practices. <br> - Suggest adjustments to feeding schedules, stocking densities, and water management strategies to maintain optimal fish health. | 
| ***Water Quality Optimization***   | <br> - Analyze historical water quality data to identify patterns and anomalies that may affect fish health and productivity. <br> - Recommend adjustments to water treatment processes, aeration systems, and filtration methods to optimize water quality parameters such as pH, temperature, salinity, and oxygen levels. <br> - Propose strategies for minimizing the impact of external factors such as weather events and pollution on water quality. |
| ***Harvest Planning and Forecasting*** | <br> - Predict optimal harvest times based on historical data, fish growth rates, and environmental conditions. <br> - Provide forecasts for expected harvest yields and quality based on current conditions and trends. <br> - Offer recommendations for scheduling harvests, grading fish, and post-harvest handling to maximize profitability and minimize waste. |
| ***Resource Allocation and Efficiency*** | <br> - Analyze resource utilization metrics such as feed consumption, energy usage, and labor hours. <br> - Identify areas of inefficiency and suggest improvements in resource allocation, equipment utilization, and operational workflows. <br> - Optimize resource allocation based on production goals, cost constraints, and environmental sustainability considerations. |
