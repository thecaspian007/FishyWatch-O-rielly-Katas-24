## Status:
Accepted

## Context:
The context for this decision is to discuss the integration of machine learning (ML) techniques and models into the Fishy Watch system for various use cases. Machine learning can enhance predictive analytics, anomaly detection, decision support, and optimization in fish farming operations.

## Decision:
After evaluating the potential benefits and considerations, we have decided to incorporate machine learning into the Fishy Watch system for the following use cases:

### 1. Predictive Analytics for Harvesting:
- Utilize machine learning algorithms to predict optimal harvesting times based on historical data, environmental factors, fish health parameters, and market conditions.
- Predictive analytics can help farmers make informed decisions about when to harvest, maximizing yield and quality while minimizing losses.

### 2. Anomaly Detection in Water Quality:
- Implement machine learning models to detect anomalies in water quality metrics such as pH levels, temperature, salinity, and oxygen levels.
- ML-based anomaly detection can alert farmers to potential water quality issues early, preventing fish health problems and optimizing water management practices.

### 3. Fish Health Monitoring:
- Develop machine learning models to monitor fish health based on behavioral patterns, activity levels, parasite detection, and disease symptoms.
- ML-based fish health monitoring can provide early warnings of health issues, enabling timely interventions and preventive measures.

### 4. Environmental Impact Assessment:
- Use machine learning algorithms to assess the environmental impact of fish farming operations, including water usage, waste management, and ecosystem health.
- ML-based environmental impact assessment helps in sustainable farming practices and compliance with regulatory requirements.

### 5. Harvest Yield Optimization:
- Employ machine learning techniques to optimize harvest yields by analyzing factors such as fish growth rates, feeding patterns, water quality, and environmental conditions.
- ML-driven yield optimization can maximize production efficiency, minimize resource wastage, and improve overall farm profitability.

## Consequences:
### Pros:
- Machine learning integration enhances predictive capabilities, anomaly detection, and decision support in fish farming operations.
- ML-driven insights enable proactive management, early problem detection, and optimization of farming practices.
- Improved harvest yields, fish health monitoring, and environmental impact assessment contribute to sustainable and efficient farming.

### Cons:
- Machine learning implementation requires expertise in data science, model development, training, and validation.
- Data quality, labeling, and feature engineering are critical for ML model accuracy and reliability.
- Continuous monitoring, tuning, and updating of ML models are necessary to adapt to evolving farm conditions and data patterns.
