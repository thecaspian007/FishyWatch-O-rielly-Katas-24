## Date:
2024-04-04

## Status:
Accepted

## Context:
The context for this decision is to define the machine learning model training process and establish a feedback loop for continuous improvement and optimization of machine learning models used in various use cases within the Fishy Watch system.

## Decision:
After evaluating the machine learning use cases and considering model performance, data availability, and business objectives, we have defined the following approach for machine learning model training and feedback loop:

### Machine Learning Model Training:
1. **Data Preparation**:
   - Prepare labeled datasets for machine learning model training, including historical sensor data, fish health records, environmental factors, and harvest outcomes.
   - Perform data cleaning, preprocessing, feature engineering, and normalization to ensure high-quality input data for model training.

2. **Model Selection**:
   - Choose appropriate machine learning algorithms and models for each use case, such as regression models for predictive analytics, classification models for anomaly detection, and clustering models for environmental impact assessment.
   - Experiment with different algorithms, hyperparameters, and model architectures to identify the best-performing models for each task.

3. **Training and Validation**:
   - Train machine learning models using labeled training data and validate model performance using holdout or cross-validation techniques.
   - Evaluate model metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to assess model effectiveness and generalization capabilities.

### Feedback Loop and Model Iteration:
1. **Continuous Monitoring**:
   - Implement continuous monitoring of deployed machine learning models to track performance metrics, detect drift, and identify model degradation over time.
   - Set up monitoring alerts and thresholds for model performance deviations, data distribution shifts, and concept drifts.

2. **Feedback Collection**:
   - Collect feedback from system users, domain experts, and operational data to gather insights, identify model weaknesses, and validate model predictions against real-world outcomes.
   - Incorporate user feedback, domain knowledge, and corrective actions into the feedback loop for model refinement and improvement.

3. **Model Retraining**:
   - Trigger automated model retraining based on predefined criteria such as data drift, model degradation, or performance thresholds.
   - Implement batch or online retraining strategies to update machine learning models with new data and insights, ensuring model relevance and accuracy.

## Consequences:
### Pros:
- Defined machine learning model training process ensures quality data preparation, model selection, and validation for effective model deployment.
- Feedback loop and continuous monitoring enable model performance optimization, drift detection, and adaptation to evolving data patterns.
- Iterative model retraining and refinement enhance model accuracy, robustness, and relevance to business needs.

### Cons:
- Machine learning model training and feedback loop require ongoing resources, infrastructure, and expertise in data science, model development, and monitoring.
- Balancing model complexity, interpretability, and computational costs in the training process requires careful trade-offs and optimization strategies.
