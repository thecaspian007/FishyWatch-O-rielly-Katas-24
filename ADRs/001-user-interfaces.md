## Date:
2024-04-02

## Status:
Accepted

## Context:
The context for this decision is to determine the user interface options for the Fishy Watch system. We need to consider factors such as accessibility, user experience, scalability, and device compatibility.

## Decision:
After evaluating the requirements and considerations, we have decided to provide the following user interfaces for the Fishy Watch system:
- Responsive Web Interface: A responsive web application accessible from desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. This interface will cater to general users and provide access to Fishy Watch functionalities from various devices.
- Native Mobile Apps: Native mobile applications for Android and iOS platforms. These apps will offer enhanced user experiences tailored for farmers, field workers, and users who rely on mobile devices for real-time monitoring and management.
- Software Development Kits (SDKs): SDKs will be provided for integrating Fishy Watch functionalities into third-party applications and systems. This will enhance the flexibility and utility of Fishy Watch by enabling custom integrations and extensions.

## Consequences:
### Pros:
- Accessibility: Offering a responsive web interface ensures accessibility from a wide range of devices, while native mobile apps provide optimized experiences on smartphones and tablets.
- User Experience: Tailoring interfaces for different devices enhances user experience and usability, improving user engagement and satisfaction.
- Scalability: The chosen interfaces are scalable and can handle large amounts of data and concurrent users effectively, supporting Fishy Watch's growth and adoption.
- Device Compatibility: Compatibility with rugged industrial devices used during sea harvests will be ensured, possibly through specialized interfaces or APIs.
- Flexibility: Providing SDKs empowers developers to build custom integrations and extend Fishy Watch functionalities, enhancing its utility and versatility.

### Cons:
- Development Effort: Building and maintaining multiple interfaces (web, mobile, SDKs) requires additional development effort and resources.
- Consistency: Ensuring consistency across different interfaces in terms of features, design, and user experience may require careful coordination and management.
- Compatibility Issues: Keeping up with platform updates and ensuring compatibility with evolving technologies and devices may pose challenges.
