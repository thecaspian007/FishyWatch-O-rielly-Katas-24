# ADR-014: Deployment Strategy for Fishy Watch

## Date:
2024-04-04

## Status:
Accepted

## Context:
The Fishy Watch system requires a robust deployment strategy to ensure seamless deployment, scalability, reliability, and efficient management of the application. The strategy should also incorporate Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) practices using GitLab for version control, Docker for containerization, Kubernetes for orchestration, and deployment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for scalability and cloud-native capabilities.

## Decision:
1. **Version Control with GitLab**:
   - Utilize GitLab for version control, branching strategies, code reviews, and collaboration among development teams.
   - Leverage GitLab CI/CD pipelines for automated testing, building Docker images, and deploying application updates.

2. **Containerization with Docker**:
   - Containerize Fishy Watch components using Docker containers for portability, consistency, and isolation of application dependencies.
   - Define Dockerfiles for each service, specifying dependencies, build steps, and runtime configurations.

3. **Orchestration with Kubernetes**:
   - Deploy Docker containers using Kubernetes for container orchestration, scaling, load balancing, and automated management of containerized applications.
   - Define Kubernetes deployment manifests, services, ingress controllers, and resource configurations for each microservice.

4. **Deployment on Google Cloud Platform (GCP)**:
   - Host Fishy Watch application on GCP for cloud-native capabilities, scalability, high availability, and managed services.
   - Utilize GCP Kubernetes Engine (GKE) for managed Kubernetes clusters, automatic scaling, monitoring, and integration with GCP services like Cloud Storage, Cloud SQL, and Pub/Sub.

## Consequences:
### PROS:
- **Scalability**: Kubernetes on GCP provides auto-scaling capabilities to handle varying workloads efficiently.
- **Reliability**: GKE ensures high availability, automatic updates, and fault tolerance for the Fishy Watch application.
- **Automation**: GitLab CI/CD pipelines automate testing, building, and deploying application updates, reducing manual intervention and errors.
- **Consistency**: Docker containers ensure consistent environments across development, testing, and production environments.
- **Cloud-native**: Deployment on GCP leverages cloud-native services, security features, and managed infrastructure for optimal performance.

### Cons:
- **Complexity**: Managing Kubernetes clusters and Docker containers requires expertise in container orchestration and cloud infrastructure management.
- **Costs**: Hosting on GCP may incur costs based on resource utilization, Kubernetes cluster size, and usage of managed services.

## Notes:
- Ensure proper access control, secrets management, and environment-specific configurations in GitLab CI/CD pipelines and Kubernetes deployments.
- Implement monitoring, logging, and alerting solutions (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana, Stackdriver) for proactive management and troubleshooting of deployed services.
- Regularly review and optimize CI/CD workflows, Docker images, Kubernetes configurations, and GCP resources for performance and cost efficiency.
- Document deployment processes, rollback procedures, disaster recovery plans, and system architecture diagrams for transparency and knowledge sharing among teams.
