# ADR-000: Microservices Architecture

## Date:
2024-04-02

## Status:
Accepted

## Context:
The context for this decision is the architectural approach for the Fishy Watch system. We need to decide between a microservices architecture and a monolithic architecture.

## Decision:
We have decided to adopt a microservices architecture for the Fishy Watch system. This decision is based on the need for scalability, flexibility, and easier maintenance and deployment of individual components.

## Consequences:
### Pros:
- Scalability: Microservices allow us to scale individual components independently based on demand.
- Flexibility: Each microservice can be developed, deployed, and maintained independently, enabling faster iteration and innovation.
- Decoupled Services: Microservices promote loose coupling, making it easier to replace or update components without affecting the entire system.
- Technology Diversity: Different microservices can use different technologies based on their specific requirements.
- Resilience: Failure in one microservice does not necessarily affect the entire system.

### Cons:
- Increased Complexity: Managing multiple microservices adds complexity in terms of deployment, monitoring, and coordination.
- Communication Overhead: Inter-service communication requires careful design to avoid latency and reliability issues.
- Distributed Data Management: Data consistency and synchronization between microservices need to be handled effectively.
