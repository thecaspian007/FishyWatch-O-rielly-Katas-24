# ADR-011: Data Retention and Purge Policy

## Date:
2024-04-04

## Status:
Accepted

## Context:
The context for this decision is to define the data retention and purge policy for the Fishy Watch system. We need to establish guidelines for storing data, managing data lifecycle, and purging obsolete or redundant data to optimize storage resources and comply with data privacy regulations.

## Decision:
After careful consideration and analysis, we have defined the following data retention and purge policy for Fishy Watch:

### Data Retention Policy:
1. **Raw Sensor Data**:
   - Retain raw sensor data for a defined period (e.g., 1 year) for historical analysis, trend identification, and machine learning model training.
   - Define retention periods based on data usage, regulatory requirements, and storage capacity.

2. **Processed Data**:
   - Store processed data, analytics results, and aggregated metrics based on business needs and reporting requirements.
   - Retain processed data for a longer duration (e.g., 3-5 years) for trend analysis, audit trails, and long-term insights.

3. **Alerts and Notifications**:
   - Maintain alert logs, notification history, and event logs for a sufficient period (e.g., 6 months) for audit trails, incident analysis, and compliance monitoring.
   - Archive critical alerts and notifications beyond the retention period for reference and historical analysis.

### Purge Policy:
1. **Data Purge Automation**:
   - Implement automated data purge processes and scripts to remove expired or obsolete data according to the defined retention periods.
   - Schedule regular data purges to optimize storage resources and maintain data cleanliness.

2. **Anonymization and Deletion**:
   - Ensure sensitive or personally identifiable information (PII) is anonymized or deleted securely as per data privacy regulations and best practices.
   - Implement data anonymization techniques for retained data to protect user privacy and comply with data protection laws.

3. **Backup and Archive Management**:
   - Manage backup and archive data separately from operational data, following backup retention policies and disaster recovery strategies.
   - Define backup retention periods, archival storage locations, and data retrieval procedures for backup and archive data sets.

## Consequences:
### Pros:
- Defined data retention and purge policy ensures efficient data management, storage optimization, and compliance with regulatory requirements.
- Automated data purge processes reduce manual intervention, minimize storage costs, and maintain data hygiene.
- Anonymization and deletion policies protect user privacy, mitigate data security risks, and uphold data protection standards.

### Cons:
- Data purge automation requires careful configuration, testing, and validation to avoid accidental data loss or deletion errors.
- Balancing data retention periods with storage costs, performance considerations, and legal requirements requires ongoing monitoring and adjustments.
